"""The scheduler process.

Runs recurring maintenance tasks in a long-lived process instead of a shell
`while true; sleep; python manage.py ...` loop in docker-compose, so Django
only boots once instead of paying startup cost on every tick.

Everything it calls is independently runnable and idempotent, so a restart
never double-runs anything and a missed tick is picked up by the next one.
